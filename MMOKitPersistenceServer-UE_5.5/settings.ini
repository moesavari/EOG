; When no database is detected, the persistent server will create a database for you with a certain collation.
; The collation will determine whether or not it's accent-sensitive.
; An accent-sensitive collation will allow your players to have distinct characters with difference accents, e.g. Laureline and Lauréline
; An accent-insensitive collation will allow your players to have only one, e.g. Lauréline
; The setting becomes irrelevant after the database has been created.
